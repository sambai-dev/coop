def valid_body() -> str:
    return """## Contribution tier
Tier C — executor, authentication, storage, receipts, or isolation.

## Declared scope
Repair one independently useful parser behavior without claiming the sibling command.

## Root invariant
Every accepted candidate is classified once and rejected candidates never fall through.

## Reproduction and RED evidence
RED: the focused test failed on the unchanged source because the valid label was skipped.

## Changes
Repair the classifier predicate and keep the parser contract otherwise unchanged.

## Adversarial coverage
- [x] null-like and annotated values
- [x] leading spacer cells and classifier fallthrough

## Validation
- Head: 0123456789abcdef
- Checks: focused regression, affected suite, lint, and required CI are green.

## Non-goals and remaining work
The separate all-target command remains out of scope and is recorded independently.

## Safety and compatibility
No wire-format change; the accepted input set only gains previously valid cases.

## Completion state
- Implementation: complete for the declared scope
- Validation: complete on the exact head above
- Review: pending maintainer approval
- Integration: pending merge through the protected branch
